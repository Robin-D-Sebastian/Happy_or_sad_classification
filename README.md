# Happy_or_sad_classification

In this project I have taken about 20 images as input and used binary classifiaction to find out whether a person is happy or sad.

Epoch: 50
Activation : ReLU
Optimizer : RMSprop
ImageDatagenerator from Keras that will give labeling to the images automatically.
Loss: binary cross entrop, because it is a special case of cross entropy working on only two classes.
